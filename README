TRACK YOUR AFTER-FIX TASKS

Create a configuration file with bugs and your corresponding after-fix tasks:
  # Take a nap
  bug 579522

Occasionally run "after-fix.py config-file" to find out which of the
tracked bugs have been fixed.


PREVENT WORKAROUNDS FROM OUTLIVING THEIR PURPOSE

After-fix configuration files can specify files to scan for bug mentions.

  # Look for assertions we can stop ignoring.
  contents assertions-to-ignore.txt

  # Look for tests we forgot to re-enable.
  contents *.list in ~/trees/mozilla-central/

After-fix has heuristics to distinguish intentional mentions of fixed
bugs. For example, it ignores the phrase "test for bug 123456".
